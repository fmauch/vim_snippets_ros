## Vim snippets for ROS
This repository contains UltiSnips that get quite useful when working with ROS. Currently they cover python, cpp and xml 
(for launchfiles).

### Prerequisites
For this to have any effect, you'll have to have the [UltiSnips](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips) package installed.

### Installation
Use a package manager such as [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) and add the package
to your `~/.vimrc`:

```
Plug 'fmauch/vim_snippets_ros'
```
